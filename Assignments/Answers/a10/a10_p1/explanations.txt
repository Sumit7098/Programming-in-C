## After commenting 'using namespace std' out


All the following identifiers are undefined: 'string', 'cout', 'endl', 'getline', 'cin'
	Because all those are classes and functions that have been defined in
	the standard namespace, which is a logical container hold a logical 
	grouping of unique identifiers or symbols.

Possible solution: To use std:: before each one of the afore mentioned classes/functions.
For strings, we could also use C strings (an array of characters with '\0' at the end).


## After commenting 'Critter::' out



All the indentifiers in Critter.h aren't recognized anymore. 
And the functions are considered as incomplete types. All this because we are trying to
access member methods and member variables of a class without creating an object nor
referring to that class (using Critter::).

Possible alternative solution: Is to put the declarations and definitions in one folder.
	However, this might cause some security issues.
